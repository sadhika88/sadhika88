🌸 Hey, I’m Sadhika 👩‍💻✨

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Software Tester (Manual + Automation) passionate about delivering quality-driven software solutions. I believe that every bug caught early makes the product stronger, faster, and more reliable.

💻 My expertise lies in Selenium with Java, TestNG, and Hybrid Frameworks. Alongside, I have a strong foundation in Manual Testing, API Testing (Postman, REST Assured), and Database Testing (SQL, Oracle). I am also exploring Cucumber, Playwright, Appium, and Python Selenium to keep pace with modern QA practices.

🌱 After a career break, I have upskilled myself through continuous learning and hands-on projects. Today, I am actively working on building a portfolio of meaningful testing projects to showcase my skills and capabilities. My focus is on writing efficient test cases, automating workflows, and contributing to flawless product releases.
